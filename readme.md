## About

This is some code I wrote a while back when I was first learning about MVC in php. I was following http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw28-krO7ZM (that is part 1). 

I found it and decided to put it up and I hope to actively work on it. 

## Who's it for

Anyone who is learning MVC for the first time. I will update the notation in the code, but it should be useful for anyone who wants to have a go at playing around with an MVC. 

It is very basic and definitely shouldn't be used in a production environment.
